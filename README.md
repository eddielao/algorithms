# Algorithms and Data Structures

This project dives deep into the realm of data structures and algorithms. Codings are done in Java, JavaScript, and Ruby. The goal is to implement and to give my own take on various data structures and algorithms. Further goal will be to add visualization with a full stack application. This documents my own findings and serves as a living repo for learning the subjects.

## How To Test the Codes

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

For codes written in Ruby, after cloning you can run the following commands for RSpec testing.
```
$bundle install
...
$rspec spec
```

### Data Structures

* Array

* Linked List

* Heap

### Abstract Data Types

* Stack

* Queue

* Priority Queue

* Dictionary / Hashmap

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
