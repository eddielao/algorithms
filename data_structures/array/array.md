# Arrays

The random access characteristic of arrays has time complexity of O(1) which is constant.

## Operations and Their Time Complexity

Push (add an element to the end): O(1)

Pop (remove an element at the end): O(1)

Insert (at given index): O(N)

Remove (at given index): O(N)

* After removal, the elements that come after need to be shifted to keep the array contiuous.
